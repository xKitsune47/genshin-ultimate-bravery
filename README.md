## Genshin Impact Ultimate Bravery

TBD: randomizing boss to fight with this/these build/s

Idea suggested by my friend.
It was a great oppurtunity to utilize objects and mapping, which I've learned about recently. Plus API calls.

The UI design is simple and readable (or at least I hope so). The site should work on both desktops and smartphones.

I know very well that JS script is a bit spaghetti and that's because I am still learning.

Images for characters and weapons were scraped from genshin.gg, images for artifacts were called from an API. The site with the API in question: https://genshin.dev/
